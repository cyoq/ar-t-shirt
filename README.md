# ar-t-shirt

A project with the idea to bring Augmented Reality onto the clothes, using [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js) and a web browser. 
Using this [pattern](https://github.com/cyoq/ar-t-shirt/blob/master/assets/markers/pattern-fascinated-white.png) and the [website](https://cyoq.github.io/ar-t-shirt/) it is possible to see a simple model.

There was a non-ready prototype where marker is placed on the t-shirt and is succesfully read from the distance on the phone.

At the moment this project is abandoned.
